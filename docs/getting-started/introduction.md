# Introduction

## What is Graftcode?

Graftcode is a cross-runtime communication layer that enables you to call methods across languages without APIs, queues, or SDKs. It connects your modules as if they were all written in one shared codebase — no glue code, no plumbing, just logic.

## Key Benefits

- **One-command connectivity**: Use one simple package manager command to get always up-to-date client for any remote service
- **AI-ready**: Enable AI to build, orchestrate, and refactor microservices effortlessly
- **Automatic strong typing**: Get strongly-typed clients for every service, auto-generated and auto-updated
- **Out-of-the-box MCP hosting**: Spin up MCP or custom service endpoints instantly
- **Cross-language execution**: Combine multiple programming languages in a single application
- **Monolith to microservice**: Switch invocation targets through simple configuration
- **Infrastructure independence**: Code communicates through method signatures, independent from platforms and cloud PaaS

## Performance Metrics

- **70% faster** than web service in runtime
- **1/8 CPU consumption** compared to gRPC and REST for the same amount of calls
- **20 coding languages** supported
- **10 package managers** supported
